Example 1:
Solve the following problem: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
STEP
Step 1: The number of clips sold in April is 48
Step 2: Divide the number of clips sold in April by 2 to calculate the number of clips sold in May
Step 3: Add the number of clips sold in April and the number of clips sold in May to calculate the total number of clips sold in April and May
Example 2:
Solve the following problem: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
STEP
Step 1: The amount Weng earns per hour babysitting is 12
Step 2: Calculate how much Weng earns per minute babysitting by dividing the amount Weng earns per hour by 60
Step 3: Multiply the result in step 2 by 50 to find the amount of money Weng earns after 50 minutes of babysitting

Solve the following multiple-choices problem: Một người bán hàng bỏ ra 80,000 đồng tiền vốn và bị lỗ 6%. Để tính số tiền lỗ ta phải tính?
A. 80,000 : 6
B. 80,000 x 6
C. 80,000 : (6 x 100)
D. (80,000 x 6) : 100
STEP
Step 1: The capital invested is 80,000 VND, the loss percentage is 6%.
Step 2: Calculate the loss amount by multiplying the initial capital amount by the loss percentage.
Step 3: Compare the calculated results with each answer to choose the correct answer.
CODE
```python
